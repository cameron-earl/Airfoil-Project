# Airfoil-Project

This is part of a project I undertook in an engineering class. The following files are included:
<ol>
<li>The paper detailing the goals, methods, and results of this stage of the project</li>
<li>A MATLAB function that generates an airfoil shape from a NACA4 code</li>
<li>A MATLAB script that uses this function to generate a foil shape for a wind turbine</li>
<li>An example of an image that can be generated by the turbine script</li>
</ol>
